# Design Studies

*Design is all about making decisions, generally trading off non-functional criteria*

## Design studies
- Archecture design study: a series of scale models:
	- Different approaches are explored in order to get a better feel for the design space (a range of possibilities available as solutions)
- Definition: 
	- A rigotous and systematic evaluation of the factors that influence a design
	- Begin with relevant criteria, metrics & threshold
	- Comparison of various possible approaches
- Design spaces
	- Explore a space of possibilities
	- Aesthetic factors should be examined
	- Objective factors should be examined
- Factors that might be used to compare different versions of a program
	- Performance
	- Memory footprint
	- Time to construct

## Projects
- Each of the projects involves solving a design problem in several ways
	- Evaluate your solutions in a systematic way
- Overall goal of design study: repeatability
- Report:
	- 1. Context (background, motivation, vocabulary):
		- Background and motivation for the study
		- Define any specialized vocabulary necessary
	- 2. Research questions:
		- Examines the tradeoffs between various non-functional requirements
		- Each should be formulated in a neutral fashion
		- Each should be numbered for later reference
	- 3. Subject: 
		-  design study compres multiple subjects
		- Each subject should be briefly described
	- 4. Experimental conditions: 
		- A software design study normally means running several versions of a program, making measurement and evaluating the results
		- Describes the environment in which the study will take place
	- 5. Variables: 
		- Must be identified and appropriate metrics specified
		- Describes both independent and dependent variables, the units of measure and how the research questions address them
		- Include a summary table with three columns
	- 6. Method:
		- Includes the number of trials, measurement devices and tools, randomization technique, significant digits, etc.
		- Include an explicit statement of which subjects will be run and the arguments used
		- Briefly describe any statistical techniques you will use
	- 7. Results:
		- The point of conducting a design study is to produce data
		- Presents the data collected and their statistical analysis
	- 8. Disscussion:
		- Opportunity to interpret the data you collected and provide a discussion of its implications
		- Allows you to reflect on the experimentation itself
	- 9. Concludion
		- Summarize your results and draw conclustions
		- You should provide explicit answers to the research questions to the research questions you raised in the second section
- Project deliverables
	- Source code: solving a specific problem in several ways
	- Project report: contatining project-specific content
	- Design study report
