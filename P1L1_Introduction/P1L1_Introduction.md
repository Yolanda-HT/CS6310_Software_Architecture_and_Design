## Objectives
- Express the **analysis and design** of an application using **Unified Modeling Notation (UML)**
- Specify **functional semantics** of an application using the **Object Constraint Language (OCL)**
- Specify and evaluate **software architectures**
- Select and use appropriate **architectural styles**
- Understand and apply **object-oriented design** techniques
- Select and use appropriate **software design patterns**
- Understand and participate in a **design review**

## Parts
- Analyze a design problem and specify it using UML and OCL
- Software architecture
	- Different ways of thinking about and representing architectures
	- The role of non functional requirements in determining architecture
	- How architectural designs can be refined into modules that can then be implemented
- Specifics of design
	- Object design
	- Design patterns
	- Design principles
	- Design reviews
